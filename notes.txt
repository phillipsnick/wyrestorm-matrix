Few notes on the communication protocol between device and pc.



Changing input

Command: 'cir ##'

First # to contain output number, starts from 0 (eg range is 0-7)
Second # to contain input number, starts from 0

Example: cir 00
Response: s11 

Meaning output 1 is now set to input 1





All output states

Command: 'bc '
Note the space is important

Response would be along the lines of:
s11
s22
s33
s44
s55
s66
s77
s88





System mode

Command: stm
Response: stm

Notes: this auto closes after 60 seconds, the 'sto' command will be sent from the device

You may also close this system mode by sending 'sto'. Should receive 'sto' as a confirmation also.




System status

Command: sts





EDID copy

Error response: nothing
